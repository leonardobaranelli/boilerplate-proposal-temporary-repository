More precisely I need the Carrier name, MCC, MNC, ISO Country code and current Radio Access Technology (Okay this does not directly come from the SIM card but it is linked). It works perfectly on every phone, but I realized (after testing) that I'm in trouble with the newest iPhones that have an eSIM set up. I have no idea how to tell my app to read the data of the physical SIM card instead of the eSIM.\n\nI tried to search a bit on the Web about that but I found absolutely nothing...\n\nlet telephonyInfo: CTTelephonyNetworkInfo = CTTelephonyNetworkInfo()\n\ncarrierNetwork = telephonyInfo.serviceCurrentRadioAccessTechnology?.first?.value ?? \"null\"\ncarrierNetwork = carrierNetwork.replacingOccurrences(of: \"CTRadioAccessTechnology\", with: \"\", options: NSString.CompareOptions.literal, range: nil)\n\nlet carrier = telephonyInfo.serviceSubscriberCellularProviders?.first?.value // actually here originally I tried to use ?.values.first, but the result is the same\n\nlet countryCode = carrier?.mobileCountryCode ?? \"null\"\nlet mobileNetworkName = carrier?.mobileNetworkCode ?? \"null\"\nlet carrierName = carrier?.carrierName ?? \"null\"\nlet isoCountrycode = carrier?.isoCountryCode?.uppercased() ?? \"null\"\n\n/* so the problem is that the values I get are the ones from the eSIM when it is set up. If it is not, then I get the values I want. Apparently, when the physical SIM card line is set as primary, it works. But I need that code to systematically use the physical SIM data. */\n\n\nExample :\n\nI expect [physical SIM card]: Carrier name: Free, MCC: 208, MNC: 15, ISO Country Code: fr, CTRadioAccessTechnology: WCDMA.\n\nBut instead, I get [eSIM]: Carrier name: Swisscom, MCC: 228, MNC: 01, ISO Country Code: ch, CTRadioAccessTechnology: LTE.\n\nEDIT: If you know how I can read both, that's also fine to me, my goal is to detect if the user uses a Free Mobile [208 15] SIM card.\n\nswiftcore-telephony\nShare\nImprove this question\nFollow\nedited Feb 9, 2019 at 0:18\nasked Feb 9, 2019 at 0:04\nPlugN\n497\n7 bronze badges\nWhat are the actual keys you see in the dictionary when both SIMs are present? – \nWilliam GP\n \nCommented\nFeb 7, 2020 at 1:30\nAdd a comment\nReport this ad\n1 Answer\nSorted by:\nHighest score (default)\nTrending (recent votes count more)\nDate modified (newest first)\nDate created (oldest first)\n0\nlet carriers = telephonyInfo.serviceSubscriberCellularProviders?.values\n\n\nwill result in optinal array.
